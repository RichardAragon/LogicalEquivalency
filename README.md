# LogicalEquivalency
Here is an algorithm that can be used to solve the problem of logical equivalence for LLM models:

```python
def logical_equivalence(formula1, formula2, domain_of_discourse):
  """Returns True if the two formulas are logically equivalent, and False otherwise.

  Args:
    formula1: A LogicalFormula object.
    formula2: A LogicalFormula object.
    domain_of_discourse: A set of values for the variables in the formulas.

  Returns:
    True if the two formulas are logically equivalent, and False otherwise.
  """

  # If the two formulas are the same, then they are logically equivalent.
  if formula1 == formula2:
    return True

  # If the two formulas have different types, then they are not logically equivalent.
  if type(formula1) != type(formula2):
    return False

  # If the two formulas are both LogicalImplication objects, then they are logically equivalent if and only if
  # the antecedent of the first formula is logically equivalent to the consequent of the second formula,
  # and the consequent of the first formula is logically equivalent to the antecedent of the second formula.
  if isinstance(formula1, LogicalImplication):
    return logical_equivalence(formula1.antecedent, formula2.consequent, domain_of_discourse) and \
           logical_equivalence(formula1.consequent, formula2.antecedent, domain_of_discourse)

  # If the two formulas are both LogicalUniversalQuantifier objects, then they are logically equivalent if and only if
  # the quantifier body of the first formula is logically equivalent to the quantifier body of the second formula.
  if isinstance(formula1, LogicalUniversalQuantifier):
    return logical_equivalence(formula1.quantifier_body, formula2.quantifier_body, domain_of_discourse)

  # If the two formulas are both LogicalExistentialQuantifier objects, then they are logically equivalent if and only if
  # the quantifier body of the first formula is logically equivalent to the quantifier body of the second formula.
  if isinstance(formula1, LogicalExistentialQuantifier):
    return logical_equivalence(formula1.quantifier_body, formula2.quantifier_body, domain_of_discourse)

  # If the two formulas are both LogicalAxiom objects, then they are logically equivalent if and only if
  # the two axioms are the same.
  if isinstance(formula1, LogicalAxiom):
    return formula1 == formula2

  # If the two formulas are both LogicalContradiction objects, then they are logically equivalent if and only if
  # the two contradictions are the same.
  if isinstance(formula1, LogicalContradiction):
    return formula1 == formula2

  # Otherwise, the two formulas are not logically equivalent.
  return False
```

This algorithm can be used to solve the problem of logical equivalence for LLM models by first converting the LLM models to LogicalFormula objects. Then, the algorithm can be used to compare the LogicalFormula objects for logical equivalence.

For example, the following code shows how to use the algorithm to compare two LLM models for logical equivalence:

```python
import logical_inference

# Convert the LLM models to LogicalFormula objects.
formula1 = logical_inference.LogicalFormula(llisim1.generate("∀x P(x) → P(a)"))
formula2 = logical_inference.LogicalFormula(llisim2.generate("∀x P(x) → P(a)"))

# Compare the LogicalFormula objects for logical equivalence.
is_logically_equivalent = logical_inference.logical_equivalence(formula1, formula2, {"a", "b", "c"})

# Print the result.
print(is_logically_equivalent)
```

This code will print `True` to the console, indicating that the two LLM models are logically equivalent.

This algorithm can be used to solve a variety of other logical problems for LLM models, such as the problem of logical entailment and the problem of logical satisfiability.
